        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>You can never go wrong with potatoes, whether it’s a salad, 
            french-fries, or this loaded beautiful version.</p>
        <p>These are some of the best potatoes I’ve ever had, and your
             friends and family are sure to agree.</p>
        <p>These Hasselback potatoes are thinly sliced potatoes that are
             roasted to golden brown perfection, then topped with cheese
             , bacon, sour cream and green onions. An easy yet impressive
              side dish that pairs perfectly with chicken and beef!</p>

       
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 big potatoes</li>
            <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>1/4 cup melted butter</li>
            <li>black pepper and salt</li>
            <li>8 slices thin cut cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>4 slices bacon (cooked and crumbled)</li>
            <li>1/3 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons green onions</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line a sheet pan with foil, then coat the foil with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Place a potato on a cutting board between two chopsticks. Slice the potato into 1/4 inch thick slices, the chopsticks will prevent you from cutting all the way through.</li>
            <li>Repeat the process with the remaining potatoes. Place the potatoes on the sheet pan.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, butter, salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Brush the olive oil mixture all over the potatoes, making sure to get some in between the slices.</li>
            <li>Bake for 50-60 minutes until potatoes are tender and browned.</li>
            <li>Remove the potatoes from the oven; let them cool for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Insert the cheddar cheese slices in between each cut of the potatoes.</li>
            <li>Return the potatoes to the oven and bake for an additional 3-5 minutes or until cheese is melted.</li>
            <li>Top each potato with a dollop of sour cream, then sprinkle the bacon and green onions over the top. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
