        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Steer past the fast food drive-through and whip up three-ingredient Homemade French Fries in a pot, an air fryer, or oven-fry.</p>
        <p>This two-step technique results in the crispiest DIY French fries.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>potatoes</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>vegetable oil (choose a neutral oil with a high smoke point)</li>
            <li>further spices, if you want to</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak the cut potatoes in a bowl of cold water for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain off the water, spread them out on a few layers of paper towels, and pat dry.</li>
            <li>For the first fry, heat the oil in a Dutch oven or other large pot to 300 degrees. Once the oil is up to temperature, add about a third of the fries (try not to overcrowd the pot) and cook 3 to 4 minutes, until theyâ€™re tender. Remove the fries from the oil using a slotted spoon and allow them to drain on paper towels.</li>
            <li>Bring the oil come back to temperature before adding the next batch. Then repeat as you need until all the fries are par-cooked. For the second and final fry, turn the stove up and bring the oil up to 400 degrees. Carefully return a third of the fries to the hot oil and cook until golden brown and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>As they finish, take them out of the pot with a slotted spoon and let them drain on paper towels while you cook the remaining potatoes. Season the hot fries with salt and pepper (or any spice mix or seasoning blend) and serve.</li>
        </ol>
