        <h1>Friday: Potato Croquettes</h1>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>It is Friday, you probably need some food that gives you enough strength for the last hours, until you can finally knock off for this week.</p>
        <p>Here come the Potato Croquettes: better than the simple french-fries from Tuesday and even more tasty, in our humble opinion.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>750g potatoes</li>
            <li>20g butter</li>
            <li>kummel</li>
            <li>salt & nutmeg</li>
            <li>flour</li>
            <li>eggs</li>
            <li>breadcrumb</li>
            <li>2 egg yolks</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the potatoes, peel, quarter and boil them with some salt and kummel.</li>
            <li>Squeeze them while they are still hot.</li>
            <li>Mix them with the egg yolks, butter, nutmeg and salt so that they make a smooth dough.</li>
            <li>As soon as possible, form thumb-thick rolls out of the dough and cut down thumb-thick pieces.</li>
            <li>Crumb the pieces first in flour, then in eggs and lastly in breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>Roast them in well-heated fat. They are done when they are crispy-crunchy and their color is golden-brown.</li>
            <li>Bon app√©tit!</li>
        </ol>
